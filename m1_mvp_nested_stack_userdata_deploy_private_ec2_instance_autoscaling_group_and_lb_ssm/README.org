#+TITLE: AWS CloudFormation MVP Stack
#+AUTHOR: David H
#+DATE: [2025-02-05]

* Overview
This CloudFormation project creates a secure, scalable infrastructure with public and private networks, featuring an Application Load Balancer and auto-scaling EC2 instances.

* Architecture
** Network Layout
- Two public subnets for the Application Load Balancer
- One private subnet for EC2 instances
- NAT Gateway in public subnet for outbound internet access
- VPC with proper routing and security configurations

** Components
*** Load Balancer
- Internet-facing Application Load Balancer
- HTTPS listener on port 443
- SSL/TLS certificate from ACM
- Health checks configured

*** Compute
- Auto Scaling Group in private subnet
- Launch Template with user data for application deployment
- SSM Session Manager access configured
- CloudWatch logging enabled

*** Security
- SSL/TLS encryption for HTTPS traffic
- Private instances with no direct internet access
- Security groups with minimal required access
- IAM roles following principle of least privilege

* Installation
** Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- S3 bucket for template storage
- Route 53 hosted zone for your domain

** Deployment Steps
1. Upload templates to S3:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   aws s3 cp . s3://cf-bucket-123434/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.yml" --include "*.yaml"
   #+END_SRC

2. Deploy using master template:
   - Use AWS Console or CLI to create stack with =master.yml=
   - Stack will automatically create all nested stacks in the correct order:
     1. Network infrastructure
     2. SSL/TLS certificate
     3. Load balancer
     4. EC2 instances
     5. DNS configuration

** Alternative Manual Deployment
Deploy stacks individually in this order:
1. =network.yml= - Base network infrastructure
2. =certificate.yml= - SSL/TLS certificate
3. =loadbalancer.yml= - Application Load Balancer
4. =ec2.yml= - Auto Scaling Group and instances
5. =dns.yml= - Route 53 DNS configuration

* Future Improvements
** Infrastructure
- Implement cross-zone load balancing
- Add backup and snapshot strategies
- Configure enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Implement cost optimization features

** Security
- Implement WAF for enhanced security
- Add GuardDuty for threat detection
- Configure AWS Config rules
- Implement Systems Manager patch management

** Automation
- Add CI/CD pipeline for deployments
- Implement automated testing
- Add drift detection
- Create automated backup procedures

** Documentation
- Add detailed architecture diagrams
- Include troubleshooting guide
- Document monitoring and maintenance procedures
- Add cost estimation guidelines
